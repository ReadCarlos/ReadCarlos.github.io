Distance and Direction Widget: Unit testing
===========================================

The Distance and Direction Widget uses [Intern](http://theintern.io/) as its test runner.  Unit tests can be
executed directly from a browser.  To run functional tests, you will have to use either a hosted environment such as
[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

## Instructions

### Getting Intern

Install the latest version of Intern 2.x using npm at the web folder level. NPM needs to be installed first.

```
npm install intern
```

The following sections assume test folder  and node_modules (intern) folders all exist within the same parent
test WAB app folder.

### Running the units tests

#### From a browser

1. Create a test WAB app using Web AppBuilder
2. Download the test WAB app and extract to a folder
3. Create a virtual directory pointing to the location of the test WAB app
4. Deploy the DistanceAndDirection widget to the test WAB app widgets folder 
5. Install Intern components to the root folder to a web server. Note: NPM needs to be installed before calling
```
npm install intern
```
6. Open a browser and navigate to http://hostname/path-to-distance-and-direction-folder/node_modules/intern/client.html?config=widgets/DistanceAndDirection/tests/intern
7. View the results in the browser console window.  

#### Through a hosted unit test environment

The included intern configuration is not setup to use in a hosted environment.  To use a hosted environment such as
Sauce Labs see the [Configuring Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Configuring-Intern) wiki page.
