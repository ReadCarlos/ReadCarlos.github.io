## Instructions
Deploying Widget

Setting Up Repository for Development

In order to develop and test widgets you need to deploy the DistanceAndDirection folder to the stemapp/widgets directory in your Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS installation. If you use Github for windows this can be accomplished using the following steps.

1. Sync the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Repository in Windows Explorer
3. Close Github for Windows
4. Cut and paste the entire DistanceAndDirection folder into the stemapp/widgets folder
5. Launch Github for Windows and choose the option to locate the repository. This will change the location on disk to the new location.


## Workflows

### Create Lines Interactively
	* Choose the Lines tab on the Distance and Directions Widget
	* Choose the type of line that is needed to be created
	* Start an interactive session by selecting the arrow icon
	* Enter a starting and ending point on the map by clicking on the map
	* Repeat until all desired graphics have been included

### Create Lines Manually
	* Choose the type of line that is needed to be created
	* Input the first coordinate of where your line is going to start
	* Input the second coordinate of where your line is going to end
	* Press "Enter" key and the graphic will be drawn on the map
	* Repeat until all desired graphics have been included.

### Create a Line with a Range and Bearing
	* Choose the type of line that you would like to create
	* Choose Bearing and Distance from the second drop down menu
	* Input the length of the line and choose the unit type
	* Input the azimuth or angle of the line
	* Press "Enter" key and the graphic will be drawn on the map

### Create a Circle Interactively
	* Choose the Circle tab on the Distance and Direction Widget
	* Choose the type of circle you will create from in the ‘Create Circle From’ drop down list.
	* Start an interactive session by selecting the ‘Map Point’ icon
	* Click on the map to create a starting (center) point. Drag the widget to create a radius for the circle.  
	* A graphic will then be displayed on the map showing the circle you created
      Note: The ‘Center Point’ and ‘Radius/Diameter’ will update based on parameters from newly created circle.
	* If desired you can clear all graphics with the clear graphics button

### Create a Circle manually
	* Choose the Circle tab on the Distance and Direction Widget
	* Choose the type of circle you will create from in the ‘Create Circle From’ drop down list.

	* Enter the desired Radius
	* Press the **Enter** key
	* A graphic will then be displayed on the map showing the circle you created
	* If desired you can clear all graphics with the clear graphics button

### Create a Circle using the Distance Calculator Interactively
	* Choose the Circle tab on the Distance and Direction Widget
	* Expand the Distance Calculator section
	* Enter a Time
	* Enter a Rate
	* Start an interactive session by selecting the ‘Map Point’ icon
	* Click on the map to create a starting (center) point.
	* A graphic will be displayed using the calculated distance and the clicked point

### Create a Circle using the Distance Calculator manually
	* Choose the Circle tab on the Distance and Direction Widget
	* Choose the type of circle you will create from in the ‘Create Circle From’ drop down list.
	* Enter a coordinate into the **Center Point text** box

	* Enter a Time
	* Optionally change the Rate units using the **Rate** dropdown box
	* Enter a Rate
	* Press the **Enter** key
	* A graphic will then be displayed on the map showing the circle you created

### Create Ellipses Interactively
	* Choose the Ellipse tab on the Distance and Directions Widget
	* Start an interactive session by selecting the arrow icon next to the “Center Point” text box
	* Choose the location where you want the ellipse to be started from
	* Drag the cursor to the location where the major axis will end
	* Select the orientation angle of the major axis
	* select the length of the minor axis
	* Graphic(s) will then be displayed on the map showing the Ellipse you created based on the values of the parameters that were set

### Create Range Rings Manually
	* Choose the Range Rings tab on the Distance and Directions Widget
	* Input the coordinates for the Range Rings center in the “Center Point” text box
	* Fill in the associated parameters for Number of Rings, Ring Interval, Distance Units
	* Fill in the parameter for Number of Radials and press the Enter Key
	* Graphic(s) will then be displayed on the map showing the Range Rings you created based on the values of the parameters that were set
	* If desired you can clear all graphics with the clear graphics button

### Create Range Rings Interactively
